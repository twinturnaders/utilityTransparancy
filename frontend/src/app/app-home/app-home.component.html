    <h1>Welcome to Utility Transparency</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Bringing clarity to Montana's municipal water and sewer rates.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="problem">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Across Montana, water and sewer rates vary dramatically from town to town—with little transparency or public access to rate structures. Many residents pay high bills without knowing how those costs compare to neighboring communities, or how they’re calculated.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="crowdsourcing">
    <h2>How We Get the Data</h2>
    <p>This platform is <strong>crowdsourced</strong>. That means we rely on residents like you to submit bills, rate sheets, or ordinance data from your town. It’s the only way we can gather accurate, up-to-date information across all municipalities.</p>
    <p>Together, we can build a better picture of fairness, cost, and access.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the Confidence Rating</h2>
    <p>Each municipality is given a <strong>confidence rating</strong> from 1 to 5 stars:</p>
    <ul class="star-explanation">
      <li><strong class = "star">★</strong>– Based on state-level (DNRC) or outdated data</li>
      <li><strong class = "star">★★</strong>  – Inferred or partial public info</li>
      <li><strong class = "star">★★★</strong>  – One user-submitted bill</li>
      <li><strong class = "star">★★★★</strong> – Two or more consistent submissions</li>
      <li><strong class = "star">★★★★★</strong> – Verified by admin with ordinance or full review</li>
    </ul>
