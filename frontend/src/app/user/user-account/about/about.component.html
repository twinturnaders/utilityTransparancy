    <h2>About This Project</h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    This platform was built to make water and sewer rates more transparent
    across Montana communities. Many small towns face high bills, confusing
    late fees, and aggressive shut-off policies. By sharing and comparing
    information, we can give residents the tools they need to understand
    their utility costs and advocate for fairer rates.
  </p>

  <h3>Crowdsourcing Rates</h3>
  <p>
    A key part of this project is <strong>you</strong>. If you have a bill
    from your town, you can enter your rates here. The more people who
    contribute, the stronger and more accurate the database becomes. Even
    if you donâ€™t live in a town but can look up its posted rates online,
    entering those helps others too.
  </p>

  <h3>Confidence Ratings</h3>
  <p>
    Each submission includes a star-based confidence rating. This helps
    everyone see whether a rate came directly from a bill (higher
    confidence) or from another source (lower confidence). Over time, this
    system makes the data more reliable and trustworthy.
  </p>

  <h3>Compare Your Usage</h3>
  <p>
    Wondering how your bill stacks up? You can compare your own monthly
    usage with other towns. For example, if you used <em>5000 gal</em> of
    water this month, you can instantly see what that same amount would
    have cost in neighboring communities. This makes it easy to spot which
    places have higher or lower rates, and how much those differences
    really add up to.

      Together, small contributions make a big difference. Entering just
      one set of rates could help a neighbor, a nearby town, or an entire
      region better understand their costs.
